                "body": "**From Watson and Crick to Darwin**\n\nIt''s easy to forget, in 2015, just how much we know. Every 10 year old in the United States has heard the phrase \"survival of the fittest,\" and every 13 year old knows that children inherit the genes of their parents after their parents [CENSORED]. Of course organisms fight to survive and pass on their genes, and of course this is based on the transfer of DNA from parent to offspring. Of course, of course, *of course*. \n\nBut Darwin didn''t know anything about genes. He didn''t know about DNA and he didn''t know about genetic inheritance, since the work of Gregor Mendel was then still not known. I think this underscores the level of Darwin''s genius -- I find it hard to believe that I would be able to ride a boat around the world, look at some birds (I''m paraphrasing), and come up with, well, *natural selection*, without already knowing what I know. But, how do we know all that we know about genes and DNA? Is there a direct link between, say, the work of Watson/Crick, arguably the crowning achievement of 20th century biology, and Darwin? \n\nJames Watson and Francis Crick, as you may know, made their names by elucidating the structure of DNA -- the famous \"double helix.\" They, also famously, ended their first paper with a nod towards the double helix easily suggesting a way to copy DNA for the purpose of passing it on. This potential copying mechanism would, of course, facilitate the passing of the fittest DNA. But why were they chasing DNA''s structure in the first place? Well, at the time of the double helix papers in 1953, DNA''s importance as the genetic material was still relatively new. This was definitively shown by two sets of experiments. In 1944, Oswald Avery and his colleagues showed that if you mixed a deadly form of *Streptococcus* (similar to the \"strep\" in \"strep throat\") with an innocuous form, the innocuous form all of a sudden became deadly. They got the same result if they mixed the deadly bacteria''s DNA with the innocuous bacteria, but not if they mixed protein in. In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase showed that if you infected cells with viruses carrying either radioactive DNA or radioactive protein, only the radioactive DNA got into the cell. Hershey won a Nobel Prize for this work but not Chase because in the ''50s being a female scientist was like being one of those dogs that wears a tutu and stands on its hind legs. \n\nBut why did they need to prove that DNA was the genetic material? Well, before Avery and Hershey/Chase, the prevailing logic was that *proteins* were the basis of genetic inheritance, mostly on the flimsy-in-hindsight logic that proteins are more chemically diverse than DNA, which is chemically repetitive. What *did* we know before then, then? Considering what I just said, it seems counter-intuitive but the concept of chromosomes, what we know today as structural organizations of DNA, was already known at this point. However, they were only known as mixtures of DNA and protein (which we now know are just histones and other *associated* proteins that do not carry genetic information). Whether DNA or protein was doing the legwork was unknown, but proteins were favored. \n\nI''ll skip over a few other more famous scientists and talk about an under-appreciated one: Theodor Boveri. In the late 19th century he studied the nucleus of parasitic worms (who wouldn''t?!) and noted that as cells divided and reproduced, chromosomes in the nucleus vanished and then reappeared in the same orientation -- suggesting that this represented \"continuity\" in chromosomes, which is precisely the kind of thing Mendelian genetic inheritance would require (though chromosomes and inheritance weren''t formally united until Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915. He...*sigh*...also won a Nobel Prize. Boveri did not). \n\nFrom there, skipping over a few more people, it''s on to Mendel and his pea plants (and his [maybe fake](http://upress.pitt.edu/htmlSourceFiles/pdfs/9780822959861exr.pdf) data) and Darwin. Natural selection, to inheritance, to chromosomes, to DNA, to the double helix. If you are interested in reading further about any of the work or the people who did it mentioned here, the wikipedia articles are a good start but I highly recommend *The Eighth Day of Creation* by Horace Freeland Judson as mostly a history of 20th century biology. \n\n**Bibliography** \n\n* *The Eighth Day of Creation* - Horace Freeland Judson\n* *Molecular Biology of the Cell* - Bruce Alberts et al. \n* *Theodore Boveri* - Fritz Baltzer, *Science*, Vol. 144, No. 3620 (May 15, 1964), pp. 809-815 (or, alternatively, if you can''t get it because JSTOR is stupid, [this](http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1888_Boveri.php) news article that makes reference to the same article)",

Historians of science have gone so far as to say you can trace the history of evolutionary thought almost without Darwin, and thus not to take anything away from his originality in presenting an original interpretation of an age-old problem with experimental support, it is telling that Alfred Russel Wallace was able to publish almost the same theory independently several years before Darwin (though the latter had been working on it in his personal notebooks ever since the Beagle voyage).

The distribution of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) throughout plant tissues is largely responsible for controlling plant architecture.  For instance, lateral organs (leaves, branches, flowers, etc.) initiate from the shoot apical meristem at sites of local high auxin concentrations.  Today, we spend a lot of effort understanding how the patterns of auxin distribution are made, mostly focusing on the role of polar auxin transport proteins like *PIN*-family proteins.\n\nWhile Darwin predates the work that identified the chemical and the genes responsible for its synthesis, transport, and degradation, a lesson on auxin isn''t complete without mentioning Darwin.\n\nDarwin performed the first experiments that identified some sort of communication between the shoot apex and the hypocotyl (seedling stem) of seedlings.\n\nhttp://www.wikiwand.com/en/Auxin#/Charles_Darwin\n\nIt was a fairly simple experimental setup, but the conclusion is quite powerful.  Using a single light source and various objects to shade plant parts, he gained crucial insight about how plant parts interacted.\n\nhttp://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/auxin_darwin.jpg\n\nHe demonstrated that the shoot apex was sensing the light, but the result occurred in the a different tissue.  In other words, plants were not dumb masses of cells that simply propagated, but consist of dynamic tissues that interact.\n\nLater experiments would demonstrate that the signal was a diffusable chemical eventually identified as IAA.  These experiments use the same experimental system; young shoots bending toward light sources.  Of all the complex behavior that plants demonstrate, this simple model yielded insights because it was easy to manipulate and very robust.  \n\n",

                "body": "Darwin and his colleague, George Romanes, laid the foundation for comparative psychology. Consider that, without a central theory stating that all animals are in some way related, no field of biology or (in my case) psychology could assume that there would be some similarity in the functioning of different species'' biological systems.\n\nIn *The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals*, Darwin stated that humans have \"the same senses as the lower animals\". In *The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex*, Darwin stated that: \"Nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.\" These two statements set the stage for the comparative study of cognition across species, including humans, as allowing us to understand similarities and differences across species instead of assuming that any (or every) species is unique. Everything we know about the scientific bases of behaviour originates from the animal models used by Pavlov, Thorndike, and Skinner, and the theory of evolution affords us the logical step of translating the basics of behaviourism across species.\n\nThough we have to be careful not to fall into the anthropomorphic reasoning favoured by Romanes (i.e., automatically assuming that ''human-looking'' behaviours in animals are necessarily driven by the same underlying processes as in humans), Darwin helped us move away from anthropocentrism (i.e., human exceptionalism, and the general belief that humans are mechanically superior to other animals). This allows us to study a whole host of animals to compare and contrast their cognitive capabilities on any number of tasks, and to derive conclusions about the evolution and the mechanisms of human cognition. In turn, this has allowed us to use animal models for medicine and neuroscience and relate findings to humans, including those that won [O''Keefe, Moser, and Moser the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine last year](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/okeefe-lecture.html).\n\nI encourage you to check out the complete works of Darwin, available for free online:\nhttp://darwin-online.org.uk/",

                "body": "I think this is a fun question, so I''ll go through it completely hopefully. \n\nSo, first let''s talk about how much energy we eat / consume in a day. As many people can imagine or have heard, \"2000 Calorie\" diet is relatively standard (on the low end, if you are sitting there waiting to be charged all day, haha). I''ll start with this. 1 Calorie is 1 kilocalorie (the capital C means \"kilo\" in this case), and 1 calorie is 4.18 Joules. This comes out to be 8.36 MJ. \n\nSo, we have a number in the units of Joules. Let''s round up to 10 MJ. (This is a rough order of magnitude estimate, which is similar to Conman39''s estimate as well). \n\nNow, for the next part, if you charged yourself, you have to ask, what would be your power draw. Conman39 used a maximum draw from a power socket, however its very rare for your electronics at home to draw that much continuously. \n\nFor instance, lets take a look at how much [power various things draw](http://www.oksolar.com/technical/consumption.html). \n\n\nMicrowave 1,450 Watts\n\nDishwasher: 1,200 Watts \n\nAverage Computer power draw? Maybe 100-500 Watts depending on what you are doing (crazy gaming machine, maybe &gt;500 Watts. Browsing Reddit: maybe 50-100 Watts). \n\nPower required to charge a Macbook? Around 60 Watts. For some other laptops, maybe up to 120 at most, for some others much less. \n\niPhone or iPod power draw? Around 5 Watts to charge it. \n\nSo, what is a Watt? (in case you didn''t know this). It is power, represented as Joules per second. Change of energy over time. \n\nSo, now we have a power draw for conventional items. Now lets ask, what will we use to charge ourselves? (Electronics, based on their function, can change their power draw, so we can make our charger that charges us work at any speed we want, up to the highest ~2 kW before tripping a circuit breaker) \n\n**If we charge ourselves at the extreme power draw of a Microwave, it take about 1.9 Hours. If we go at the rate of a computer (250 Watts) it would take an extreme 11 hours of charging!**\n\n**If we tried to charge ourselves at the rate that we send power to a laptop (100 Watts) it would take ~28 hours! Not enough power to keep us going (but pretty close).**\n\nOne thing that is interesting to think about, if we are feeding ourselves that much power (more than a laptop would draw if at full use even!) then where does that 100 W go throughout the day? And the answer to that, is mostly to heat. Humans are essentially heat lamps. Yes, we can move things around, pedal a bicycle and exert energy in many different ways, but in the end of the day those things are quite small compared to the amount of energy we output in just heat. \n\nInterestingly enough, when engineers have to design cooling systems for auditoriums and such, this heat really matters. (Have you ever been in a small room with &gt;20 people without AC? It get''s hot fast)  When they do the calculation, a reasonable assumption is that every person is like a 100 Watt light bulb, always on when in the room. \n\nSo, now we can think about how much food costs, and how much power that actually is... If you could just eat 1 beef soft-taco from Taco Bell ([200 Calories](http://www.tacobell.com/nutrition/information)) that would be enough power to keep a laptop charging for about 4 hours! (at 60 Watts). \n\nIn the United States, we can compare this cost to the cost of power from the wall at home:[11.92 cents per kWh](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/end_use.cfm#tabs_prices-3). \n\nThat taco, if you were to make it purely from power from the wall, would cost 2.77 cents! And the power required to charge us, as humans, per day would cost only 33 cents. Just imagine, only spending 120 USD per year on food! \n\nOut of curiosity, i wanted to see how much various foods stack up in the Calories per dollar way, to see if anything can catch up to the power from the wall. [And the best I can find is that if you were to drink straight canola oil / cooking oils or from flour, that would be 200 Calories for only 7 cents, which is still 3 times more expensive than electricity from the wall](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/what-does-200-calories-cost-the-economics-of-obesity.html) (but surprisingly close, for being the highest energy / cost food I could find). \n\nIn the end though, we cannot ingest energy this way (thankfully maybe, I like eating!) and it''s definitely not efficient money wise to try to feed our laptops tacos and sandwiches (even though crumbs do end up in the keyboards).

                "body": "I am an HVAC engineer, so I''d like to give some more exact numbers on your example regarding the cooling of an auditorium.\n\nThe number we commonly use for a person seated at rest is 245 BTUH sensible (British Thermal Units per Hour) and 205 BTUH latent.  The sensible heat is heat that goes in to warming the air around us, and the latent is the heat given off in moisture (i.e. sweat), so the higher the latent is, the higher the relative humidity gets, as that meants we''re sweatng more. \n\nA light bulb does not give off any latent heat, so to compare the two means ignoring the latent part of the heat given off by a human.  BTUH is another unit for power, so converting to watts is as simple as multiplying by a number, and in this case 1 kW = 3,413 BTUH. This means a human seated at rest will give off about 72 watts of heat (245/3.413). A 100 watt light bulb does not give off 100 watts of heat, as some of it does go in to producing light, and a relatively good (and slightly hand-wavy) assumption is that incandescent light bulbs are 20% efficient (yes, they are that awful), so a 100 watt light bulb will put out about 80 watts of heat.\n\nSo, your comparison is fairly accurate when talking about simply sensible heat, but does not take in to account the latent heat given off by humans.  This is like comparing a 90 degree day in arizona to a 90 degree day in florida.  Same temperature, but the humidity in florida makes it so much more unpleasant, and is part of the reason why its so unpleasant in a room full of people.\n\nTo expand upon the auditorium example:\n\nAssuming an auditorium can seat 500 people with a full house, this means that the people will produce 122,500 BTUH of sensible heat, or approximately 35.9 kW, and 102,000 BTUH latent heat, or approximately 30 kW.  Cooling loads are commonly measured in tons, and 1 ton =12,000 BTUH.  So, if we were to put in a system to cool the space, and completely ignore all heating effects on the space from the sun, the exterior temperature, infiltration, windows, walls, equipment heat, lights, etc, this would require a system capable of putting out 10.2 tons sensible cooling and 8.5 tons latent cooling (aka dehumidification).  This means the total capability of this unit would need to be about 18.7 tons! To put it in perspective, your home unit (depending on the size of your house) is somewhere in the range of 1 to 5 tons (it could be larger if you have a really big house).  \n\nWhen you also factor in all other sources of heat (mentioned above), it can easily drive the required size of the unit to 25 or 30 tons.  Each unit draws a different amount of power, depending on how efficient it is, but a 27 ton Carrier Weathermaker will use about 32 kW to cool that space.  So, for a 4 hour performance, that means it would use 128 kWh.  Using /u/bluecoconut''s, numbers, that means it would cost the auditorium about $15.25 to cool the space in that 4 hours, and over the course of 5 months of cooling (assuming 16 hours a day of operation), it will cost about $9,100.  Imagine if your electricity bill was that high!  Not to mention, they also need to cool the rest of the building, so its not unusual that (for big buildings), it can cost several hundred thousand dollars a year to condition the space.  That''s a lot of money!",

What this means is that over the lifetime of the panel, they''re expected to produce full power (i.e. when exposed to the sun) for that much of their time. Obviously it''s highly dependent by region, so lets pick a few cities with known sunshine values per month to work with\n\n* Phoenix, Arizona in June (408.0 sunshine hours, that''s ridiculous) \n* San Fransisco, California in May (325.5 hours, very sunny!) \n* New York City, New York (268.2 hours, July, peak of summer) \n* London, UK (149.3 sunshine hours, September, heading into winter)\n* Berlin, Germany in December (37.2 sunshine hours, December, very cloudy) \n\nLet''s assume that at all other times, the solar panel output is negligible and can be ignored, so we''ll disregard any time there''s no sun. We''ll also assume that solar insolation is constant, and that we have a tracker installed so the panels always directly face the sun when sunlight is available. We take /u/bluecoconut''s worked out figure of 8.36MJ of energy per day per human, and then convert it to kilowatt hours, which is another unit of energy, it''s actually the unit you get changed for on your electricity bill. 1 kWh = 3,600,000J or 3.6MJ. \n\n8.36 / 3.6 = 2.32, so, we need 2.32 kWh of energy per day to maintain ourselves. \n\nNow all we do is simply divide the number of sunshine hours per city per month by the number of days per month and obtain a daily average number of sunshine hours. Let''s assume for this system, you have a really large battery bank where you can store all this power too. \n\ni.e. Phoenix in June = 408.0 sunshine hours / 30 days = 13.6 hours of sun per day. \n\nNow, to achieve 2.32 kWh of energy from 13.6 hours of sunlight, you''d need a panel that generates and is rated for 2320 / 13.6 = 170 Watts. That''s actually quite feasible (keep it mind it has to generate 170W constantly for 13.6 hours). \n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the most efficient mass-produced solar panels currently on the market achieve 175W/m^2 . If you had such a panel you''d (be very rich, firstly) need 170 / 175 = 0.95 m^2 of solar panel to keep you going for a full day in Phoenix, Arizona in June.\n\nRinse and repeat for other locations:\n\nSan Fransisco, California = 221 Watt panel, roughly 1.26 square metres of panel\n\nNew York City, NY = 269 Watt panel, roughly 1.54 square metres in size\n\nLondon, UK = 466 Watt panel, roughly 2.66 square metres\n\nBerlin, Germany = 1,933 Watt (1.9kW) panel, roughly 11.04 square metres in size\n\nTL;DR: Sucks to power yourself via the sun in Germany. \n\n",

Yes, there are many many applications where you can utilize the heat generated by a space load to help temper the air for that space. However, there is more to ''conditioning'' the air than just maintaining a thermostat set point of 72. Humidity, CO2 levels, VOCs (volatile organic compounds, i.e. germs), restroom smells, food smells, etc must all be considered as well. For humidity control, this means you might be having to run your air conditioner (since air conditioners not only cool the air, but dehumidify it as well) during the dead of winter if you''re building up too much humidity in your space (I can almost guarantee you are). Also, there are government regulations monitored by organizations such as ASHRAE, IMC, etc that set minimum levels of outside air that must be provided per person. So, Mall of America must be pumping in very large amounts of outside air to provide for their customers. \n\nSo, what does this all mean? While it may be true that heating is not required during winter months, its somewhat misleading. HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) is a three-headed beast, so saying you don''t use one doesn''t mean MoA doesn''t still have exorbitantly high HVAC bills, since they will still need to ventilate and  possibly dehumidify the air. And I almost guarantee they have supplemental heat for low demand periods. If 100 people are in the mall they won''t generate enough heat to warm the space. ",

Also, we would have issues of contact burns and general cellular damage, so let''s move on.\n\nOn the other hand, if instead of using dry fingers, we implanted some nice biofriendly wires (something like platinium). We''d also need to make sure we didn''t cause electrolysis of the water in your body (or otherwise we''d cause cellular damage). So we could get the contact resistance down to about 1 kOhm, but we couldn''t apply more than about a voltage (otherwise we get electrolysis).

A living person''s stomach has to (1) exert energy to digest that food, and (2) the yield is not 100% and in most cases much lower. In both cases, it really depends on the method of food preparation (eg. a giant raw piece of steak is very hard to digest, and same with raw vegetables, while processed carbohydrates such as bread and pasta break down quickly). Since no caloric guidelines on the planet currently adjust for this, it is likely that the actual caloric requirement is much lower.\n\nIt would actually be interesting to see what the actual dietary requirement would be if glucose were supplemented into the blood and basic amino acids were directly absorbed via the gut.

The trivial amount emitted as sound is rapidly converted to heat in the air/walls/etc as you get farther away.  You can convince yourself of this by calculating the wattage necessary to deafen yourself with a 100% efficient loudspeaker, and then noting that typical club audio systems consume thousands of times that much power and generally fail to immediately deafen their audience.\n\nEdit: A perfectly efficient speaker would produce a sound with an intensity of 112dB at a range of 1m, with an input power of 1W.  That''s something that could easily run off of a small battery.  It''s already loud enough to be painful, and it would cause hearing loss over a relatively short time (less than an hour).  Fortunately for people like me who like to go to raves, most speakers are on the order of 1% efficient (and earplugs are cheap).\n\nEdit 2: I recently went to a rave that advertised 100,000W of sound in a venue with a capacity of 4,000 people.  It was a pretty popular act, so let''s assume the place sold out.  That''s 400,000W of people 100% of the time, but with a sound system that peaks at 100,000W (assuming that number wasn''t just marketing BS), you won''t be drawing the maximum current 100% of the time, so I''m thinking the sound system probably doesn''t contribute more than 1/5 of the heat in that sort of environment.

The big 2 examples being:\n\n- behaviors that benefit your kin. (so that even if you die, your kin are more likely to survive - and to pass on genes that you share). This is most likely to evolve in species that (a) live near kin for some part of their lives, and (b) can distinguish kin from nonkin.\n\n- behaviors that benefit an individual who is particularly likely to help you in return in the future. This is called \"reciprocal altruism\". It is common in social species in which (a) particular individuals interact repeatedly many times, and (b) individuals can recognize each other. (edit: I forgot (c) - individuals have a good enough social memory to remember and avoid \"cheaters\")\n\nAs for your two examples: A poisonous mushroom isn''t an example of an organism sacrificing itself, because it''s not the entire organism. A mushroom is just an outgrowth of an underground network of fungal filaments; so if an animal eats 1 mushroom and dies, other mushrooms produced later by that same fungus may survive. Bees are a special case because they have unusual genetics (haplodiploidy) but in essence they are an extreme example of kin selection. If a bee manages to drive away a predator from the hive, even if it dies in the process, many copies of its genes will survive in its sisters and in the young larvae in the hive. (edit: also, as pointed by out by several commenters below, bees don''t always die when stinging other insects.)\n\nref: See the chapter on Behavioral Ecology in your book - that chapter has a whole section on evolution of altruism. For more details check out \"Evolutionary Analysis\", by Herron &amp;amp; Freeman (yes, same Freeman) &amp;amp; see ch 12 on kin selection &amp;amp; social behavior.

The basics are that bees which sting and die, do so because they can not reproduce. Because they can not reproduce their best chance for increasing their own genetic code in future generations is to protect their mother (the queen) in hopes that the queen will produce siblings to the stinging bees. In this case at least 0.5 of each worker bee''s genetic code has a chance to be carried into the next generation in the form of a sibling. \n\nThere is a lively debate to be had about if true altruism exists. But the question you have asked does not quite get to the core of that debate. You have kind of danced around multiple concepts including natural selection, altruism, group selection, and others.  \n\nI have read the Freeman book, I think it is good and will explain a lot for you. If you want to read another book that talks more about darwinian puzzles and large scale evolution questions. I recommend reading \"Animal Behavior\" by Alcock, it is one of be better textbooks that I have ever read. I believe now it is in its ninth or tenth edition. ",

                "body": "In eusocial insects, like bees and ants (and to a different extent termites and earwigs), much of what a particular insect does is dictated by the pheromones released within its environment. \n\nI study the European honey bee (Apis mellifera), so my explanation will focus on them. \n\nLet''s start with basic bee biology. \n\nThere are three castes, the female workers, make drones, and female queen. Drones are, for intents and purposes, sacks of sperms, only useful when the colony has a virgin queen. There typically aren''t a lot of them, and their genome is haploid. They have no stinger. The stinger is a modified ovipositor (egg-laying device). As such they aren''t relevant to these altruistic tests in reference to this thread. \n\nThe queen does not have barbs on her stinger. This is because when a colony needs a new queen, the workers preferentially move a small cohort of eggs into queen cells, and feed them \"royal jelly\". The first of these queens to emerge kills all the other queens. As such, her stinger is not a serrated so it doesn''t kill her. She also isn''t relevant to the altruism referenced in this thread.\n\nNow we have the workers. They have 15-17 barbs on their stinger which function like a fish hook. Once it goes in, the bee cannot pull it out, even if we can. To escape, the bee simply rips off the ovipositor, expelling its rectum and midgut. This ultimately kills the bee. \n\nBut why would workers do this? The colony as a whole shares a massive amount of genes. Virgin queens mate with drones and keep the sperm for her entire life. She then will lay unfertilized haploid eggs in drone cells, and fertilized haplodiploid eggs in worker cells, which means an individual female worker may share up to 75% of her genes with her sisters (more than a parent in other species share with their children, siblings share, etc.) This is the first reason for the \"altruistic\" behavior. It doesn''t matter whether or not the workers had choices in their development and are capable of reproducing themselves. Protecting their sisters will in turn protect up to 75% of the genes. \n\nThe next reason why they do this is simply because of pheromones. The queen releases daily pheromones to regulate the tasks of her workers (guarding the nest, foraging, feeding larvae, etc.) additionally alarm pheromone can be release from the queen or from a worker that stings you. That first sting may be an accident, it may be because the queen ordered it, or it may because the bee exhausted its preliminary warnings (headbutts, trying to kill you via heat, etc.) Whatever that cause, this pheromone is released, and you instantly have a target on you. You''ll smell bananas, and you should run. All bees defending the hive will attack. \n\ntl:dr Worker bees will sting a predator to send it away because they themselves can''t reproduce; protecting their sisters can protect 75% of their genes; protecting their queen will allow these genes to propagate. They also have to because of pheromones responses. ",
